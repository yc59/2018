## Task 1: Data exploration

- Create two plots of the data: one with age on the x-axis and length on the y-axis, and one with length on the x-axis and frequency on the y-axis.  Add axis labels and any additional information you think is relevant (e.g., average length-at-age). Include your figure in your README file like this:

- Comment on the data and plots.  Describe the properties of the data (max 250 words).


## Task 2: Methods description

- In your own words, describe how you will apply the EM algorithm to this dataset (max 250 words).

- Include a diagram of your team's approach to the problem.  This can be digital or hand-drawn and scanned in as a PDF. Again, include your diagram in the README file:
