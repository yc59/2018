## What is the value to the field of statistics?

- I have a policy when evaluating CV's of job candidates, or reading a paper.
- If the paper is about a new statistical method or machine learning algorithm and there is no software available for that method -- I simply mentally cross it off the CV.
- If I read a data analysis and there isn't code that reproduces their analysis -- I mentally cross it off.

# Computers (from a statistician's persepctive)

## What is a computer?

* Approximate definition:

> A device that accepts information (in the form of digitized
> data) and manipulates it according to a sequence of
> instructions to produce output.

* We can divide the device into two parts:
    * Hardware - physical computer equipment
    * Software - set of instructions that operate the hardware ~ computer program

## Computer architecture

Hardware

* Central Processing Unit (CPU) -- controls the computer and executes instructions  
(N.B. Many computers also contain graphics processing units (GPU's), which can be used for numerical computation.)
* Memory -- fast storage
    * Registers -- within the CPU, superfast
	  * Random Access Memory (RAM) -- slower
* Mass storage -- e.g., hard disk drives -- (traditionally) much slower
* Input/Output -- keyboard, screen, printer, etc.

***

Software

* System software -- e.g., Microsoft Windows, Linux
* Application software -- e.g., Microsoft Word, SAS, R
* Programming software -- e.g., Microsoft Visual C, GNU C, R
    * Implementations of programming languages -- C, S, etc.

## Programming languages

Classified according to:

* Level of abstraction
    * low level = close to the specific computer hardware - black-belt stuff
    * high level = far from the hardware (so can run on many different systems) and closer to natural language - can focus on tasks to be achieved
* Generality: higher level languages tend to be more specialized in application
* Speed/Efficiency: lower level is generally faster (although not always true)
* Generations: 1st-5th

## Programming language generations

* 1st generation (1GL): machine language - CPU-specific set of instructions.  E.g. `10110000 01100001` on a Pentium-type CPU means move the value 97 into a certain register.  
    * Relatively few different instructions ($\approx100$ in an Intel chip) and many of these are required to achieve anything useful.
* 2nd generation (2GL): assembly language.  
    * A human-readable form of machine language.  E.g., the above in assembly is `mov al, 061h`
      * `al` is the name of the register and `61h` is 61 in hexadecimal, which is 97 in decimal

***

* 3rd generation (3GL): more human-friendly, CPU-independent language with variables, data and code structures.  
    * E.g.  
FORTRAN 
```
IF(X.EQ.12) LET A = B
```
BASIC 
```
if (x=12) then a = b
```
Pascal 
```
if (x=12) then a := b;
```
C 
```
if (x==12) a = b
```
    *	Also *object-oriented* languages such as C++ and Java.
    *	Most programs you use (e.g., Windows, Unix, R, etc.) are written in a 3GL.

***

* 4th generation (4GL): language designed with a specific application in mind -- lots of built-in capabilities for that application. 
    * database query languages (SQL), graphical user interface (GUI) creators (Visual Basic), mathematics languages (Mathematica, Maple), statistics languages (R, SAS).
* 5th generation (5GL): language based around solving problems, given the problem specification.  User does not need to explicitly write the algorithm for solving the problem.  
    * Prolog.  Used is in artificial intelligence studies.

## Compiled vs Interpreted

* All languages must be turned into machine code before they can be executed by a computer
* Two approaches:
    * Interpret: turn each line into machine code as it is entered using an `interpreter' and run it straight away.
    * Compile: once the code is written and saved into a file, turn it all into machine code in one go using a `compiler'.  Then, it can be run.

* Pros and cons:
    * Interpreted code provides instant feedback -- good for short, run once jobs.  Tend to be used by 4GLs.
    * Compiled code runs faster (compiler can *optimize*) -- good for jobs that will be run many times.  Tend to be used by 3GLs.

## (Trivial) example of optimization

* Slower:
```
for i = 1 to 10
  j[i] = log(k) + i
next
```
* An optimizing compiler could recognize the inefficiency and automatically turn it into something like the following while compiling.
* Faster:
```
l = log(k)
for i = 1 to 10
  j[i] = l + i
next
```


## What programming language/package should we use for statistics?

* For simple *do once* stuff (by the way, *do once* is a myth), we can use our favourite stats package, perhaps via a GUI 
    * but there is no *reproducible trail* of how the analysis was done
* For more complex stuff, but still only *do once* or *do a few times*, use a statistical 4GL within an interpreter
* For production software, or where efficiency is important
    * use a 3GL and compile the code, or
    * prototype in a 4GL and then re-write the bits that are slow in a 3GL which you call from the 4GL


# Software for statistics 

Most of the time you have no choice!

*   Use what the client uses/wants
*   Your company only has a license for one piece of software, or your
    IT department will only support one package
*   You are taking MT4113 and we are only teaching you R

## If you do have a choice:

* If you have a zero budget, use R -- it's free!
* If you only use the package rarely and want to do something quite standard, choose something easy to use (point and click) SPSS, etc.
* For enormous datasets, use SAS (or maybe Microsoft R Open, or R with Hadoop)
* If you are doing research in statistics, start with R (or maybe MATLAB/Mathematica)

***

* For computer-intensive work, or something that you wish to automate
    * Prototype with an easy-to-use but extensible package (R)
    * Find out which bits are slow and port them to a 3GL
    * ... or re-write the whole thing into a 3GL
    * Consider what kind of user interface you need
* For specialized applications, look at the specialized packages

## R

* a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics 
* open source, free
* widely used by academic statisticians
* based on the S 4GL
* extremely extensible
* rapidly developing and maturing

***

* Current version is 3.5.1
* Widely used in academia, making its mark elsewhere
* Core development team of approx 20 members, with many hundreds contributing extensions ( packages )
* Supported by the R Foundation and (commercial) R Consortium.
* `useR!` conferences, etc.

## Why use R?

 * Pros:
  * Contains cutting-edge methods (usually as add-on packages)
    * Highly extensible
    * Cannot beat the price
* Cons:
    * Steep learning curve
    * Less well supported than a commercial package?
    * Greater tendency to ignore backwards compatibility?

## Learning resources for R

* Introduction to Stats with R books (see reading list)
* R project home page [http://www.r-project.org/](http://www.r-project.org/)
    * Up-to-date list of books
* Other books see additional reading list (on Moodle)
* R bloggers - a collection of hundreds of blogs on R [http://www.r-bloggers.com/](http://www.r-bloggers.com/)

## Evolution of an R programmer

*  Phase 1 
    * R as calculator

* Phase 2 
    * the _script_
    * 10-15 lines of code strung together to perform a task
    * might have a loop, maybe even an if-statement
    * one or two comments
    * not intended for use (or viewing) by others

* Phase 3 
    * modular programming with functions
    * undertaking a sufficiently complex analysis that organisation becomes critical
    * description of input and output are critical to ensure reusability
    
*  When performing functional programming, 
    * there are elements of the R language not previously used that become useful 

# Algorithms and computer code 

Note to self - expand again?

* Algorithm: an *ordered* sequence of *unambiguous* and well-defined
    instructions for *performing some task* and *halting* in finite time
* Important features
    * an ordered sequence
    * unambiguous and well defined instructions each instruction is clear, do-able, and can be done without difficulty
    * performs some task algorithm needs to be complete, with nothing left out
    * halts in finite time i.e., the algorithm needs to terminate
