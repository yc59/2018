DRY - do not repeat yourself

how big should a module be (old Lecture 4 stuff)

eda function (old Lecture 4), what's wrong and how to make it better
(add comments, fix global side effect)

Good programming practice stuff - abbreviated from Lecture 5
 including horizontal spacing (use the Google R code guideline?)
