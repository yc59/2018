# Topics Covered*

- The advantages of using **functions**

--

- Different types of **environments**

--

- Understanding the **scope** of variables

--

- Approaches to **testing and debugging**

--

- Software **design** for statisticians

--

- Coding **conventions and style**

# Functions

---

# Why use functions?

1. Avoid repeating the same code over and over

--

2. Self-contained

--

3. Easier to update and propagate changes

--

4. Make code more readable

--

---

# What happens in f(x) stays in f(x)

--

--

- Concept of **encapsulation**
    - send everything needed for computation into function as arguments
    - return outputs explicitly with `return()` function

# What happens in f(x) stays in f(x)

.pull-left[

- Bad practice

```{r comment='#'}

x <- 1:25

func <- function(){
  sum(x)/length(x)
  }

func()

```

]

.pull-right[

- Good practice

```{r comment='#'}

# A function to calculate the 
# mean of a numeric vector

my.mean <- function(x){
  stopifnot(is.numeric(x))
  m <- sum(x)/length(x)
  return(m)
  }

x <- 1:25
my.mean(x)

```

]

- **Q:** What are three things that make the example on the right better?
