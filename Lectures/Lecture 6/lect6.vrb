\frametitle{Cons, compared with permutation methods}
	\bi
		\item For parametric simulations, need to estimate nuisance parameters (e.g., $\sigma^2$ in the pine martin example)
		\item <2->Results will vary from run to run
	\ei
<3-> Confidence intervals can be constructed using similar methods to randomization intervals -- but there's a better way -- see next lecture...
